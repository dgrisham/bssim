#1: graph of latencies vs mean for given bandwidths
#2: graph of latencies vs block_times (colored by runid) for given bandwidths
#3: graph of latencies vs mean where bandwidth is the size of the point
#4: graph of latencies vs simulation durations for given bandwidths
#5: graph of bandwidths vs means for given latencies
#6: graph of # of files completed for most recent run over time
#7: graph of file size vs file times for given bandwidths
